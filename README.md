# Coverless-Image-Steganography
This repository runs a data hiding technique using the Haar Wavelet Transform.
To use this, two input images must be provided. One of them carries the actual data called as the coverless image. The coverless image isn't modified by even a small amount. The data is encoded as Haar Wavelets. The second image is called as the cover image. The cover image should be of a similar topic to the coverless image(Like 2 flower pictures) so that the people trying to steal the information do not get suspicious. It is slightly modified using LSB steganography. Instead of an image, a location map containing the characters can also be sent to the reveiver. The information to be hidden is written in the text file which is the third input. The program prints the message and a graphical view of the statistics.
